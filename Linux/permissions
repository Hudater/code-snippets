r= read
w= write
x= execute

1 execute
2 write
4 read



*Add these number to give permissions. There is defined order to give permissions in Linux, here it is:


ADMIN:  rwx  4+2+1= 7
GROUP:  rx   4+2=6
PUBLIC: r    4=4

1+2+4= 7

Example of permission where giving permissions for a file named test.txt:
(chmod 764 test.txt, this gives: {execute, write and read permission for admin} {read and write for group} and {read for public})
